# AlienVault Python/Django Coding Test

### Goals:

* Part I: Consume JSON from an HTTP endpoint and transform it into an API request in Django
Rest Framework (http://www.django-rest-framework.org/). Some of the values will be straight 1-1
mappings while others will require aggregation.
* Part II: Construct a simple Django model to track users accessing the page and also allow this to
be read from the API.

### Notes about the base files (ask us if you haven’t received them):
* __Urls.py__:​ Django checks this first for routes. Create routes for /api/threat/ip/x.x.x.x and /api/traffic.
* __Views.py__:​ urls.py calls a view from views.py. In this case, the views are subclassed from DRF
APIView. For this exercise, the view is a simple call to generate an IPDetails object, located in
threat.py
* __Threat.py__​: IPDetails data object does the work. It takes a raw argument, and makes a call to the
reputation datastore, and then stores the results in the data object. IPDetails does double duty
here as both the plain data object that can be serialized and the data interface.
* __Serializers.py__​: The DetailsSerializer maps IPDetails to JSON output. You’ll find many references
to other serializers beyond serializers.Field() in the DRF framework. Ignore that for now since we
are reading data back only and not writing. You will need to use serializers.Field(many=true) for
activity output, however.

### The JSON source is here:
Known Malicious:
http://reputation.alienvault.com/panel/ip_json.php?ip=69.43.161.174

Known Safe: (Will return blank result, doesn’t error-check IP value so do this beforehand)
http://reputation.alienvault.com/panel/ip_json.php?ip=8.8.8.8

## Part I: Simple JSON Transform to API Call
1. Make a simple Web API using Django Rest Framework (http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) in
Python that can take any IP as input. URL format: /api/threat/ip/x.x.x.x as the format. Provide reasonable
error-checking for IP input (empty, invalid, etc.)

2. Map the information from reputation.alienvault.com to this output API

| Reputation API | Your New API | No reputation result?
| --- | --- | --- |
| Address | Address | Input 
| _id.$id | Id | ""
| Reputation_val | Reputation_val | 0
| The value of the earliest first_date.sec in activites[] | first_activity | null
| The value of the latest last_date.sec in activities[] | Last_activity | null
| Activities | (* see activity mapping below, empty set if no reputation result)| []
| Enumeration of every unique value of activity.name in activities[] | Activity_types | []
| -- | Is_valid: true if valid input, false otherwise | true if valid input, false otherwise

\* Activities should be mapped as follows:

| Reputation.Activities | New api activity
| --- | --- |
| Name | Activity_type
| First_date.sec | First_date
| Last_date.sec | Last_date

Ignore all other JSON values for the purpose of this exercise.

3. See right column in first table on how to handle an error where no results are returned. I’ve included an
is_valid field to set true or false on bad input. Feel free to add any API fields you think are relevant (error
codes, etc.)

4. On a user access to the API, determine if it is their first access by looking to see if they have a cookie
set for a unique user ID (call it AlienvaultID). If they do not have a cookie set, set it to a random string to
12 characters and set it to expire in one year. (Yes, this isn’t totally scientific but it simulates the behavior
of many marketing automation packages.)

## Part II: Track Users and Return Traffic Info at API Endpoint
1. Create a Django model to track simple statistics about who accesses the API via the web.
  a. IP Address
  b. Timestamp (epoch)
  c. API endpoint accessed (“/api/threat/ip/1.2.3.4”)
  d. The value of AlienvaultID set in #4 in the previous section
2. On each visit to the API endpoint above, record statistics about the user visiting.
3. Create another API endpoint using DRF at /api/traffic/ that does a simple dump of all the traffic
stored in the model above sorted by AlienvaultID.
Structure for JSON:
```
[
  {
    "alienvaultid": 123456789012,
    "visits": [
      {
        "address": "1.2.1.34",
        "timestamp": 3828188382,
        "endpoint": "/api/details/1.2.3.4"
      },
      {
        "address": "1.2.1.34",
        "timestamp": 3828188389,
        "endpoint": "/api/details/2.3.4.5"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "alienvaultid": 123456789013,
    "visits": [
      {
        "address": "5.31.3.6",
        "timestamp": 3828188390,
        "endpoint": "/api/details/1.2.3.4"
      },
      {
        "address": "28.11.4.5",
        "timestamp": 3828188396,
        "endpoint": "/api/details/2.3.4.5"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Other Stuff:
* Python 2.7 preferred. Environment setup (Python + Django + DRF) is up to you.
* Disable all authentication for your web API. Anon access is fine.
* There is no need to write an API consumer for this exercise. Meter the traffic in part 2 using
simple calls to the API endpoint in Part I.

### DELIVERABLE:
* Two working demonstrations on URLs of your choice. Deploy somewhere that can be publicly
accessed.
* GitHub/Dropbox/zip/etc. of your code.

Let us know when you parse through this what your expected delivery date is. Thanks and looking
forward to your work!
